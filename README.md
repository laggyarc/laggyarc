# about me


**laggyarc/laggyarc** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... A project in software development. And college as a whole
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... OS security foundation, software development and java code
- ✍️ my hobbies consist of ... creating animated cards using still effects and chroma keying green screen videos and making graphic designs for those cards
- 🖼️ eventually I wish to ... learn more about graphic design but with the rise of Ai that seems unlikely
